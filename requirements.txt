# Python Dependencies for Standalone Server
# Note: tkinter comes included with standard Python, no installation needed

# This file is empty because all necessary dependencies
# (tkinter, subprocess, threading, etc.) already come with standard Python.

# If you need to install Python:
# 1. Download Python 3.8+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
# 2. During installation, make sure "tcl/tk" is selected
#    (usually comes by default)
